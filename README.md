# IPTABLES Port Forwarding Script

This Bash script automates the management of iptables rules for port forwarding, making it easier to add, remove, and display port forwarding rules on a Linux system. It includes features such as automatic backup of current iptables rules, checking for `iptables-persistent` installation, and interactive management of port forwarding rules.
